RxCookbook
==========

This is a community-driven cookbook for
[RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) and libraries around it.

## What's in here?
Ideally this is the place where you would find the answers for all your
RxQuestions. We have 2 sections: FAQ and Samples. In FAQ we don't usually have
code, where in Samples we show specific implementation for a topic. Let's say
you want to know how to implement a login logic - there should be a sample for
it. But if you want to know why you should use `disposeBag` or when you can use
different method of disposing - this is what FAQ should be responsible for.
